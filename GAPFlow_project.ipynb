        "​In the current AI landscape, whenever an LLM (Large Language Model) reaches a dead end, fails a task, or ends a session, valuable logic is wasted. We call this the \"Informational Gap.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "​Instead of letting this logic disappear, Gap Flow treats it as \"raw sugar\" that can be refined and reused.\n",

        "# ​2. The Core Philosophy: Recycling the \"Gap\"\n",
        "​Current AI systems are \"islands.\" They don't learn from their immediate failures in real-time across different sessions. Gap Flow bridges this by creating a dedicated infrastructure to capture, clean, and store logical residues.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "​Logic is not trash: If an AI fails a calculation today, that partial reasoning is a building block for tomorrow.\n",

        "​AI Gap (The Collector): Captures the \"hot\" residue at the moment of exit or error.\n",

        "​AI Stopped (The Vault): A \"frozen\" state of context stored in the cloud. It organizes information by Topic/Theme, allowing any authorized AI to \"thaw\" and reuse that logic instantly."
